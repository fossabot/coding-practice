# Split Messages
# You have a long piece of text, and you want to send it to your friend as a series of SMS messages. 
# Your text consists of English letters (uppercase and lowercase) and spaces. 
# The text doesn't contain any leading spaces at the beginning or trailing spaces at the end. 
# There are no two consecutive spaces in the text. One proper SMS can contain at most K characters. 
# If the text is longer, it needs to be split into parts. Each part should be sent in a separate message 
# that fulfills the maximum length requirement. Text may not be split within words. The order of the words 
# and the messages can't change, so that we can later concatenate the resulting messages to retrieve the original text. 
# Spaces at the start and end of all messages are removed, and thus are not accounted for in the overall message length.

# The goal is to count the number of SMS messages needed to accommodate the whole text, keeping the length of each message 
# less than or equal to K. The total number of SMS messages must be kept to a minimum, however; it would not be acceptable, 
# for example, to take the wasteful approach of programmatically sending one SMS for each word in the original text!

# Write a function: public func solution(_ S: String, _ K: Int) -> Int that, given a string S representing the text that 
# needs to be split and an integer K that is equal to the maximum possible message length, returns the number of SMS messages needed.

# For instance, given string S="SMS messages are really short" and K = 12, your function should return 3. You could split this 
# text into proper messages as follows: "SMS" "messages are" "really short"

# If it's impossible to split text into proper SMS messages, your function should return âˆ’1. Assume that: K is an integer 
# within the range [1..500]; S is a non-empty string containing at most 500 characters: only letters and spaces, there 
# are no spaces at the beginning and at the end of S; also there can't be two or more consecutive spaces in S.

def solution(S:str, K:int) -> int:

    # input validation
    if K < 1 or  K > 500 or len(S) > 500:
        return -1
    
    if len(S) <= K:
        return 1
    
    message_count = 0   # could also keep a list of the messages and return its length, but not required
    tokens = S.split()
    current_message = ""
    
    for token in tokens:
        
        # we can't send this token in a SMS without splitting it, so we can't send this message
        if len(token) > K:
            return -1
        
        # this token contains non-letter characters
        # if not token.isalpha():
        #     return -1
        
        # print("Token: {}, current_message: {}, len: {}".format(token, current_message, len(current_message)))
        
        # I have capacity for a space, so add the next token and a space to the current message
        if len(current_message + token) <= K-1:
            current_message += token + " "
            
        # I only have capacity for the token in this message
        elif len(current_message + token) <= K:
            current_message += token
            
        # No more capacity, must start a new message
        else:
            message_count += 1
            current_message = token + " "
            
    # if the last token did not fit in the previous message, send it on its own
    if len(current_message.strip()) != 0:
        message_count += 1
